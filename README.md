# Python Pig Game

This is the second Python project tutorial I have followed along on. I added functionality after the video to the program in the form of a second Python program by the name of pig_solo.py. This Python program is instead single player instead of multiplayer. This single player pig game utilizes a top score text file to keep track of high scores across sessions. The user is displayed the current high score each time they play and if they surpass the high score, they are prompted with the ability to save their score as the top score alongside a nickname. This project demonstrates further understanding of python random number generation alongside python file reading and writing.
